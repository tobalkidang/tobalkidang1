		<br>
		Beach tourism is currently the most significant tourist attractor in the Philippines. Philippine beaches are ranked highly in international travel rankings
		for their natural beauty. Substatian drawback in the Philippine tourism industry is due to undeveloped infrastructure and terrorism.

		Some of the Earth's most important environmental corridors are located in the Philippines such as
		the <b>Coral Triangle</b>, the most important aquatic biodiversity hotspot in the world. Places such as the 
		Sibuyan Island, Mt. Mantalingajan, Dinagat Islands, Central Panay Range, Verde Island Passage, Tubbataha Reef, Turtle Islands,
		and much more are also visited by these researchers. The country is also a hotspot for Anthropology and Archaeology due to places such as

<h2>Boracay Beach</h2>
<p>The Boracay Beach is perhaps the most popular beach resort in the Philippines. Boracay is a major tourist hub in the Philipines, attracting 
tourists from within and outside the country.
Boracay is an island, about 7 kilometers long and 1 kilometer wide, located in Western Visayas. 
Boracays waas awarded as the 2012 Best Island in the World by the international travel magazine <i>Travel + Leisure</i>. In 2014, the island 
was placed on top of the "Best Islands in the World" list published by the International Magazine <i>Conde Nast Traveler</i>/
<br>In 2018, the government decreed a 6-month closure to rehabilitate and renovate the island's obsolete sewage system.
It was reopened in October of the same year. It was closed again in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. </p>

<h2>Rizal Park</h2>
<p><i>Liwasang Rizal</i>, also known as Luneta, is a historic urban park in Ermita, Manila. It is one of
the largest urban park in Asia, covering an area of almost 60 hectares. The site on wherre the park is situated 
was originally known as Bagumbayan during the Spanish Colonial Period. It is adjacent to the walled city of Intramuros.
This park is where Rizal was executed, trigerring the Philippine Revolution that expelled the Spanish from the country.
And look at that photobomber behind the monument. </p>

<h2>Banaue Rice Terraces</h2>
<p>The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are the oldest and most extensive in the world. These terraces were carved using 
rudimentary tools. Many of these terraces are falling into disrepair due to lack of maintainace and growingly worse climate conditions.
The rice terraces are a major tourist destination in places such as Ifugao and Mountain Province.
The five clusters inscribed as part of the Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are Batad, Hungduan, Mayoyao Central, and Nagacadan. Batad and Bangaan
are under the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Banaue but are not called the Banaue Rice Terraces.</p>

<h2>The Waters</h2>
<p>
The Philippines is encased from every coast in what is called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coral_Triangle">Coral Triange</a> This 
area holds an immense importance to marine ecosystem, holding an exeedingly sizable number of marine species in just a small area. Its biological resources categorize
 as a global hotspot of marine biodiversity that contains more than 76% of the world's shallow reef-building coral species, 37% of the world's fishes, 50%
  of razor clams, six out of seven of the world's sea turtles, and the largest mangrove forest in the world. Sadly, the area is caught
   between human activity and is aggressively exploited. The very heart of the Triagle called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verde_Island_Passage">Verde Island Passage</a> is under immense pressure due to human activity and exploitation. </p>

<h2>Biodiversity</h2>
<p>The wildlife of the Philippines includes a significant number of endemic plant and animal species. The country's surrounding waters contain the 
highest level of marine biodiversity in the world as I have mentioned above. The Philippines is one of the seven megadiverse countries as well
as a global biodiversity hotspot. The Philippines has among the highest rates of new species discovery with sixteen new species of mammals discovered in the last ten years alone.  </p>

<h2>Chocolate Hills of Bohol</h2>
<p>The Chocolate Hills is a geological formation in Bohol. There are over a thousand of these hills spread over and area of fifty square kilometers.
They are covered in green grass but the chocolate interior is revealed come summer. Chocolates from these hills taste like Hershey's dark chocolate but 
the public is not advised to consume it due to concerns that people may eat the hills flat, and there'd be no more Chocolate hill left. In 2016, five 
people were arrested trying to smuggle 12 tons of chocolate out of Bohol to Cagayan De Oro city. In response to that incident, the governor decided to 
close the area from tourist activity for six months.  </p>

<h2>Magellan's Cross</h2>
<p>This cross was planted by Ferdinand Magellan upon arriving in Cebu on the 17th of March 1521. This cross
is housed in a chapel next to the Basilica Menor del Santo Nino on Magallanes Street in front of the city centre
of Cebu City. A sign below the cross states that the original cross is encased inside the wooden cross made of tindalo
wood. This is to protect the original cross from people chipping parts for souveneir in the belief that the crosspossesses 
magical powers like the ones Harry Potter has.
Some believe that the original cross has been destroyed or that the cross is a replica planted by the Spaniards
years later.
